this is a final capstone project for Cisco ethical hacker course by Paro Cyber

Objectives
For this Final Capstone Activity, you will conduct a complete penetration test starting with reconnaissance and then launching exploits against vulnerabilities that you have discovered. Finally, you will propose remediation for the exploits.

This assessment is in the form of a cybersecurity capture the flag exercise. You will use your ethical hacking skills to locate files that contain flag values. You will then report the flag values that you found as part of the assessment.

In this simulation of an ethical hacking engagement, you will use tools to exploit vulnerabilities that you discover in order to reach a goal. This can entail a trial-and-error approach that requires persistence and may include a degree of struggle. For your own skill development, working through this struggle can be productive. If you are completely stuck, ask your instructor for assistance.

Challenge 1 – Use SQL injection to find a flag file.
Challenge 2 – Use web server vulnerabilities to investigate directories and find a flag file.
Challenge 3 – Exploit open Samba shares to access a flag file.
Challenge 4 – Analyze a Wireshark capture file to find the location of a file containing flag information.
